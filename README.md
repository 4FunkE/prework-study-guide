# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## To complete the prework for the coding boot camp I needed to create a webpage. This webpage was created for boot camp students to learn basic coding skills, set up their devices for class and organize what they have learned into a coherent and usable website. I was able to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, README, and URL.

## Usage

To use this website you will need to use the uniform resource locator. From there you will be able to view the notes for HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaSript. You can use the notes from the webpage to study or go over basic coding knowledge. This knowledge can teach you new information or reiterate old knowledge. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the Javascript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
